# PhotoScript
Bash scripting for use of dcraw &amp; Imagemagick in termux - for processing RAW photos

This is really just a place to keep the relevant files & for pull requests by anyone who wants to propose a development in the script or a setting that's used by it.

The discussion & examples are separate & intended to be mobile friendly (the intention is that the script can be run on a phone, using termux).
